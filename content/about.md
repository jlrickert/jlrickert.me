I'm a software engineer based in Minnesota with a passion for building robust, scalable systems. My experience spans both frontend and backend development, with a strong focus on cloud infrastructure and DevOps.

## Background

I started programming early and have been hooked ever since. Over the years, I've worked on projects ranging from real-time data processing systems to interactive web applications. I'm particularly interested in how systems scale and how to architect applications for reliability and performance.

## Technical Skills

**Frontend**: React, TypeScript, JavaScript, CSS, HTML
**Backend**: Go, PHP, Node.js, REST APIs, gRPC
**Infrastructure**: Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, cloud-native architectures
**DevOps**: CI/CD pipelines, Infrastructure as Code, monitoring, and observability

## What I Enjoy

- Solving complex problems with elegant solutions
- Building tools that make developers' lives easier
- Contributing to open source projects
- Writing technical content to share knowledge
- Exploring new technologies and frameworks
- Running and staying active
- Baking (especially traditional recipes like my family's coffee cake)

## Let's Work Together

I'm interested in projects that involve building scalable systems, improving developer experience, or exploring new technologies. Whether you need help with a specific feature, architecture guidance, or a full-stack development engagement, I'd love to hear from you.
