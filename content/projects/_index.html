Selected builds and ongoing work across product engineering, infrastructure, and tooling.

Each project page captures implementation details, stack choices, and tradeoffs from real delivery work.

Primomed, Lee J Sackett, and B2MFG are client sites I built while working at [eCreativeWorks](https://www.ecreativeworks.com/).
