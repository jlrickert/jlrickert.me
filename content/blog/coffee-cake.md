This treasured recipe comes from my great grandmother and represents a unique variation of coffee cake found in Central
Minnesota. German and Northern European immigrants who settled in the region during the 1800s brought their beloved
“Kaffee und Kuchen” (coffee and cake) traditions with them. They adapted their Old World recipes using ingredients
available in their new homeland, creating distinctive regional variations that became family treasures passed down
through generations. What makes this recipe particularly special is the cottage cheese filling—a hallmark of Midwestern
German baking traditions that adds exceptional moisture and richness to the cake. These yeast-risen coffee cakes were
traditionally baked for church gatherings, family reunions, and afternoon coffee visits, cementing their place in
community life throughout Central Minnesota.

## Coffee Cake Dough

- 4 cups (960 ml) milk
- 2 yeast
- salt
- 1 cup (240 ml) sugar
- 1 cup (240 ml) shortening
- 4 egg yolks
- 8 cups (1920 ml) bread flour

## Instructions

Heat milk to scalding, cool to 120°F (49°C), add shortening, sugar and salt. In large bowl mix 4 cups (960 ml) flour and yeast,
add milk and yolks, mix until dough is elastic. I use an electric mixer. Stir in additional flour (approximately 4 cups (960 ml),
dough should be on the stickier side.) until you are able to knead for 8 to 10 minutes. Let rise until double in bulk.
If you use quick rise yeast, roll 1/3 of the dough into 14 x 11 inch (35 x 28 cm) rectangle. Place filling on half of the dough and fold
over. Place dough in a 7 x 11 inch (18 x 28 cm) coffee cake pan and bake. If you use regular yeast after first rising punch down and let
rise again. Bake in 350°F (175°C) oven for 20 - 25 minutes in the center of the oven. After taking the cakes out of the
oven, lightly mist the tops of the cakes with water. This helps set the topping. After 10 minutes remove cakes from
pans. This recipe can be halved to make 4 coffee cakes.

## Topping

- 1 cup (240 ml) butter or margarine (blue bonnet margarine gives a softer crumb)
- 1 ½ cups (360 ml) flour
- 1 cup (240 ml) sugar
- 1 teaspoon (5 ml) cinnamon Mix flour sugar and cinnamon together, cut in butter until course crumb. Sprinkle ½ cup (120 ml) of topping
  on each cake. Filling Options Coffee Cake Filling
