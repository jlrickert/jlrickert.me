# Welcome to My Blog

Hello! I'm Jared, and this is my first post. I'm excited to share my thoughts on
software development, Go programming, and building things on the web.

## What to Expect

On this blog, I'll be sharing:

- **Technical deep dives** into Go and web development
- **Project write-ups** showcasing things I've built
- **Best practices** and lessons learned from real-world projects
- **Notes** on tools, frameworks, and interesting technologies

## About This Site

This portfolio site is built with Go and uses a custom post management system.
Each post is written in Markdown with YAML frontmatter for metadata. It's a
lightweight approach that keeps things simple and performant.

## Let's Connect

If you find something interesting or want to discuss ideas, feel free to reach
out. I'm always interested in connecting with other developers and hearing about
what you're working on.

Thanks for stopping by, and I hope you find the content useful!
